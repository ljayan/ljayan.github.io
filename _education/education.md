Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography, Department of Aerospace Engineering,
Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India
December 2024
• Advisor: Prof. Manikandan Mathur
• Thesis: Eddies and Currents in the Bay of Bengal with Applications to Freshwater Transport
• CGPA: 8.75/10
• Highlights:
– Investigated the transport and stirring of tracers by oceanic flows across multiple spatial and temporal scales
in the Bay of Bengal.
– Analyzed a wide variety of data, including satellite observations, ocean model outputs, mooring data, and
ship-based in-situ measurements.
– Developed a 1.5-layer reduced gravity model from scratch to study the role of local and remote wind forcing
on advective stirring in the Bay of Bengal.
– Extensively used dynamical systems frameworks such as Hyperbolic LCS and Lagrangian-Averaged Vorticity
Deviation (LAVD) for data analysis and interpretation.
