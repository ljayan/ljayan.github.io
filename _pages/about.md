I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS – TIFR), Bengaluru, India, working with [Prof. Rama Govindarajan](https://www.icts.res.in/people/rama-govindarajan). Prior to joining ICTS, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Geophysical Flows Lab, Centre of Excellence, and the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India, working with [Prof. Manikandan Mathur](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QbrM7-gAAAAJ&hl=en).

I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Mathur in December 2024, with a thesis titled *Eddies and Currents in the Bay of Bengal with Applications to Freshwater Transpor*. My doctoral research focused on understanding how tracers are transported and stirred by oceanic flows across different spatial and temporal scales in the Bay of Bengal. 

My current research interests include *particle transport in atmospheric and oceanic flows; meso- and submesoscale dynamics in the ocean; tracer transport and mixing in the upper ocean; Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS); and layered ocean models*.
