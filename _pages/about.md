I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS – TIFR), Bengaluru, working with [Prof. Rama Govindarajan](https://www.icts.res.in/people/rama-govindarajan) on particle transport in atmospheric and oceanic flows. Prior to joining ICTS, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Geophysical Flows Lab Centre of Excellence at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I worked with [Prof. Manikandan Mathur](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QbrM7-gAAAAJ&hl=en) on submesoscale dynamics in the northern Bay of Bengal.

I completed my Ph.D. at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras under the supervision of Prof. Manikandan Mathur. My doctoral research focused on understanding how tracers are transported and stirred by oceanic flows across different spatial and temporal scales in the Bay of Bengal.

My current research interests include *particle transport in atmospheric and oceanic flows; meso- and submesoscale dynamics in the ocean; tracer transport and mixing in the upper ocean; and layered ocean models*.
