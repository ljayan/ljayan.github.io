I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Geophysical Flows Lab, Centre of Excellence, and the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India, working with [Prof. Manikandan Mathur](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QbrM7-gAAAAJ&hl=en). I completed my Ph.D. in the same department under the supervision of Prof. Mathur in December 2024, with a thesis titled “Eddies and Currents in the Bay of Bengal, with Applications to Freshwater Transport.”

My doctoral research focused on understanding how tracers are transported and stirred by oceanic flows across different spatial and temporal scales in the Bay of Bengal. My current research interests are in oceanic meso- and submesoscale dynamics, tracer transport and mixing in the upper ocean, Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), geophysical wakes and eddies, and reduced-gravity ocean models.
